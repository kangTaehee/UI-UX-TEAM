I need to confess it to you.

604

It has to do
with the three virtues.

605
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,280
There's no shame in being
fearful before battle.

606

In fact, it's a testament

Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1094
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:33,644
Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1095
01:46:33,727 --> 01:46:36,271
Cold is the morning

1096
01:46:36,355 --> 01:46:38,774
Warm is the dream

1097
01:46:38,857 --> 01:46:41,276
Chasing the answers

1098
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,946
'Til I can't sleep

1099
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,240
Will I be stronger

1100
01:46:46,323 --> 01:46:48,700
Or will I be weak

1101
01:46:48,784 --> 01:46:52,871
When you're not with me?

1102
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:58,961
Who am I without my armor

1103
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,924
Standing in my father's shoes?

1104
01:47:05,008 --> 01:47:09,304
All I know is that it's harder

1105
01:47:10,264 --> 01:47:15,853
To be loyal, brave, and true

1107
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:33,787
Look at me

1108
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:36,331
You may think you see

1109
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:39,001
Who I really am

1110
01:47:39,084 --> 01:47:41,587
But you'll never know me

1111
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,964
Every day

1112
01:47:44,047 --> 01:47:49,094
It's as if I play a part

1113
01:47:49,178 --> 01:47:51,221
Now I see

1114
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:53,807
If I wear a mask

1115
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:56,518
I can fool the world

1116
01:47:56,602 --> 01:48:01,315
But I cannot fool my heart

1117
01:48:04,109 --> 01:48:08,947
Who is that girl I see

1118
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:14,077
Staring straight back at me?

1119
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:19,208
When will my reflection show

1120
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:26,256
Who I am inside?

1121
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,842
I am now

1122
01:48:28,926 --> 01:48:34,014
In a world
where I have to hide my heart

1123
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:36,600
And what I believe in

1124
01:48:36,683 --> 01:48:38,727
But somehow

1125
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:43,982
I will show the world
what's inside my heart

1126
01:48:44,066 --> 01:48:49,029
And be loved for who I am

1127
01:48:51,657 --> 01:48:56,703
Who is that girl I see

1128
01:48:56,787 --> 01:49:01,542
Staring straight back at me?

1129
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:06,755
Why is my reflection someone

1130
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:11,051
I don't know?

1131
01:49:11,718 --> 01:49:14,888
Must I pretend

1132
01:49:14,972 --> 01:49:21,520
That I'm someone else
for all time?

1133
01:49:21,603 --> 01:49:26,692
When will my reflection show

1134
01:49:27,067 --> 01:49:31,113
Who I am inside?

1135
01:49:31,196 --> 01:49:35,701
There's a heart
that must be free

1136
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:38,537
To fly

1137
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:43,876
That burns with a need to know

1138
01:49:43,959 --> 01:49:49,256
The reason why

1139
01:49:49,339 --> 01:49:54,511
Why must we all conceal

1140
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:59,266
What we think, how we feel?

1141
01:49:59,349 --> 01:50:03,979
Must there be a secret me

1142
01:50:04,062 --> 01:50:09,193
I'm forced to hide?

1143
01:50:09,276 --> 01:50:14,531
I won't pretend that I'm

1144
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:19,203
Someone else for all time

1145
01:50:19,286 --> 01:50:24,666
When will my reflection show

1146
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:31,715
Who I am inside?

1147
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:42,684
When will my reflection show

1148
01:50:43,685 --> 01:50:50,651
Who I am inside?
